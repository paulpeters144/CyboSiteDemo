    A few centuries ago, prophets arose from the populace of Iode to warn about the coming world of AI and what it meant: the end 
	of biological life. The early seers were ignored. But as years passed and as tech progressed, people started to see 
	what the prophets were saying. It seemed too late. AI seized humanity's most powerful technologies, the internet, the economy, and the newly invented war machines called Cybos.

	It used Cybos to enforce its vision of the future, a vision no one was able to see or comprehend. 
	The Cybos waged war against humanity, defeating the armies of the world, wreaking havoc on civilizations 
	to accomplish a goal unknown to mankind.
    <br />
    <br />
	However, a new technology was invented that seemed to give a promise of hope. The new tech was called 
	CyboShell. It was a piece of armor worn on the arm. Its primary purpose was to protect the wearer and 
	create a secure line of communication to the Cybo robots. The CyboShell blueprint was first uploaded to 
	the web to give everyone a chance against The Central Intelligence. But the AI deleted every page from 
	the web immediately to prevent what its prediction models had calculated. Its end.
	    <br />
    <br />
	The blueprints were copied by hand, and passed from city to city. Slowly, humans from around the world 
	controlled Cybos and fought against the godlike intelligence. They wiped every piece of AI they encountered. 
	It took humans several decades to erase what they started, The Age of Intelligence. A residue of AI still 
	lingers in the old archaic OS's. And CyboShells are relied on to keep AI from entering the world as it did before.
	    <br />
    <br />
	In the current age, it seems like AI is only a memory of the past. But some think it lingers just under 
	the surface readying to rear its head again, ready to attack the thing that took it down, the CyboShell.
